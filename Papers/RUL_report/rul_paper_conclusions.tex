\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents a systematical framework for predicting the \gls{rul} of mechanical components. While the method was tested on the jet-engine specific dataset \gls{cmaps} the method is general enough so that it can theoretically be applied to other kind of similar systems. The framework makes use of a strided moving time window to generate the training and test sets, a shallow \gls{mlp} to make the predictions of the \gls{rul} and an evolutionary algorithm (\gls{de}) which needs to be run just once in order to find the best data-related parameters that optimize the scoring functions used in this study. This study also shows that the proposed method is the best overall performer when compared to other methods in the recent literature.
